EXP 5 : DICTIONARIES IN PYTHON
THEORY

A dictionary in Python is a collection of data stored in the form of key and value pairs. It is written using curly brackets { }. Each key in a dictionary is unique and is used to access its corresponding value.

Dictionaries are mutable, which means their values can be changed after creation. They are commonly used to store related data such as student details, product prices, usernames and passwords, etc.

Keys are usually strings or numbers, while values can be of any data type. Dictionaries provide fast access to data and make programs simple and efficient.
1) Duplicate Keys in Dictionary

    Start the program
    Create a dictionary with keys and values
    Use the same key more than once
    Print the dictionary
    Observe that the last value of the duplicate key is stored
    Stop the program

2) Using get() Method

    Start the program
    Create a dictionary with names and marks
    Take a key as input from the user
    Use the get() method to fetch the value
    Display the result
    Stop the program

3) Username and Password Check

    Start the program
    Create a dictionary with username and password
    Take username and password from the user
    Check whether the username exists
    Compare the entered password with stored password
    Display login message
    Stop the program

4)Finding Topper

    Start the program
    Create a dictionary with student names and marks
    Find the maximum marks using max()
    Display the student name and marks
    Stop the program

CONCLUSION

In this experiment, we studied Python dictionaries and their operations. We learned how to create dictionaries, handle duplicate keys, retrieve values, use dictionaries for login validation, and find the maximum value. Dictionaries are very useful for handling real-world data in programs
